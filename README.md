### Intro
Welcome to the OsmAnd Live Tracker. This small little application works (primarily) by integrating with the online tracking functionality of the OsmAnd+ android application wich sends location data at a set interval to a web address. This application uses the Google Maps API to display both the most recent location and a history on a map.

### Disclaimer
This particular setup works well on my system. I cannot guarantee that it will work well on yours. All parts of this are experimental, and could potentially cease to function or exist at any time. Your mileage may vary.

### Usage and Operation
This package works by accepting the location through the `./tracking.php` script and saves the location in two different places:

* ./resources/location.latest - the most recent location sent to `tracking.php` is stored in this file. It is overwritten upon each call to `tracking.php`. This is location is represented by a pin on the google map is is the centerpoint of the map.

* ./resources/location.history - location data is appended to this file each time data is sent to `tracking.php`. This historical location information is shown as a simple line segment on the map.

Make sure that the `resources` folder has the appropriate write permissions that the user `www_data` can create the files in the `resources` folder.

The actual data is displayed via the `index.php` file in the map directory. If the site is hosted at `www.example.com`, the map could be displayed by visiting `www.example.com/map/`. 

The historical location track will be displayed for as long as there is location data in the `log.body` file. To reset this file, one simply has to visit `www.example.com/reset_track.php` and the `log.body` file will be overwritten by a blank file. This effectively clears out the track.
